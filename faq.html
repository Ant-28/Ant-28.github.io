            <h2>What's your name? What should I call you?</h2>
            <p> If you've talked to me, you may see me answer this question differently.
                Short Answer: Ant. Long Answer: <a href="https://ant-28.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2025/10/05/aboutmyname.html">Read this.</a>

            <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
            <p>
                Like this Website, I like building things. I want to make it more of a hobby when I have the time to do so. 
                <br>
                I also really like playing video games. Probably the game I've sunk the most time into is <i>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</i>, especially after installing Tamriel Rebuilt. 
                I will say though that's not a complete answer. 
                <br>
                I do go back to the occasional Flash game, and I easily have ~400 hours (combined) playing most of the Assassin's Creed Games.
            </p>

            <h2>I followed you on LinkedIn. Why haven't you responded?</h2>
            <p>If I don't know you I'm less likely to accept the request. If I do know and haven't, I probably haven't gotten around to it.
                I'm also pretty forgetful when it comes to updating my profile. Last but not least, I despise LinkedIn with a burning passion and will open it only when I need to.
            </p>

            <h2>Editor of Choice?</h2>
            <p>VSCode. I like Emacs and one of these days when I get around to making a terminal emulator for NTEmacs I'll make the switch.
               Until then I'm on VSC, which I really like (unless I'm writing R or Scala).
            </p>

            <h2>Is that all?</h2>
            <p>No! Feel free to send me any questions and I'll jot 'em down here.</p>
